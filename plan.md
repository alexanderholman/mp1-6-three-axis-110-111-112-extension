# MP1.6 - Three-Axis Extension (110|111|112)

## Goal

Extend to 3-axis networks and test whether poly-axis effects strengthen.

## Scope

- Prioritize 3D-capable families: `island`, `checker`
- Keep `box` and `saw` as bi-axis references

## Deliverables

- 3-axis energetic and structural outputs
- Strain and electronic comparisons vs 1-axis and 2-axis
- Robustness notes for geometry choices

## Checklist

- [ ] Lock 3-axis representative geometries
- [ ] Gather DFT and MACE outputs
- [ ] Run matching analysis stack
- [ ] Export extension figures and summary table
